        This project first started when I took a magazine writing class in the Fall of 2019 with professor Carlene Hempel. I was looking on Twitter for a historian to profile for one of my assignments when I came across an article 

        on the MetFern Cemetery. This then lead me to Alex Green, a local disability historian who has been researching the lives of those buried in the cemetery for the past five years. I became increasingly fascinated and horrified 

        the more I learned about MetFern, Fernald and MetState, and so my profile evolved into my final class project. By the end of the semester, I still felt as if there was more to the story –– I needed more time to explore the 

        nuances of these institutions' complicated history and they fit into the larger fabric of American society. I decided to continue on with is as an Honors in the Discipline research poroject starting in January 2020 under the supervision
        
        and advisement of Carlene Hempel. </br></br>

        The histories of these institutions and the experiences of those who lived within their walls has opened my eyes to a underlooked part of American history. Working on this story has irrevocably changed and shaped my perception of 

        American society and history –– this will stay with me for a very long time, both as a journalist and as a person. I hope the work I have done will bring some measure of dinity and justice to those buried under unnamed graves. </br></br>

        I would like to thank my advisor Carlene, to whom I eternally grateful for.  All of our late night texts and weekly meetings have pushed me to become a better journalist and have ensured that this story was reported and presented to the best of its ability. I 
        
        would also like to thank Szu Yu Chen, who is responsible for the design and development of this website. Without her, I would be lost in a sea of code. My many thanks to every who agreed to speak with me and share their stories 

        during this six-month process. I am blown away by their compassion and willingness to share their experiences.
